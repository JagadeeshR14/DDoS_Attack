# DDoS_Attack

## ABSTRACT :
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks poses a growing threat to Internet stability,
demanding advanced detection mechanisms. This project introduces a sophisticated DDoS
attack detection system for Software-Defined Networking (SDN) using a hybrid LSTM and
RNN architecture, achieving an impressive 97.70% detection efficiency. Unlike traditional
methods, this system employs deep learning to automatically extract high-level features from
low-level network traffic data, overcoming limitations of statistical divergence models. In the
dynamic realm of cybersecurity, where DDoS attacks evolve, conventional defenses,
particularly statistical divergence methods in SDN, struggle due to a lack of granularity.
Experimental results validate its effectiveness in SDN with a remarkable 97.70% detection
efficiency. This adaptability enhances the systemâ€™s resilience against evolving DDoS tactics,
establishing it as a robust defense mechanism for SDN infrastructures. The deep learning
approach, coupled with the hybrid architecture, provides a proactive defense against the
dynamic threat landscape. With its 97.70% efficiency, the system emerges as a pivotal
component in fortifying SDN against the pervasive threat of DDoS attack.
